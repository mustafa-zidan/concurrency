/**
 * Comparison of Threading Models
 * 
 * Here's a quick comparison of the different threading models in Kotlin:
 * 
 * 1. Thread/Runnable:
 *    - Pros: Direct control, familiar Java API
 *    - Cons: Heavyweight, limited by system resources, no built-in cancellation
 *    - Use when: Working with legacy code, need direct thread control
 * 
 * 2. Coroutines:
 *    - Pros: Lightweight, suspendable, structured concurrency, cancellation support
 *    - Cons: Kotlin-specific, learning curve for suspending functions
 *    - Use when: Most Kotlin applications, especially with async operations
 * 
 * 3. Flow:
 *    - Pros: Stream processing, backpressure handling, rich operators
 *    - Cons: More complex API, requires coroutine understanding first
 *    - Use when: Working with streams of data, reactive programming
 * 
 * For most Kotlin applications, coroutines are the recommended approach for concurrency.
 * They provide the best balance of performance, simplicity, and safety.
