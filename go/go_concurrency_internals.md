## Goroutine Internals

### What is a Goroutine?

A goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime. Unlike OS threads, goroutines are multiplexed onto a smaller number of OS threads. This is achieved through a technique called **M:N scheduling**, where M goroutines are scheduled onto N OS threads.

### Internal Structure

Internally, a goroutine is represented by a `g` structure in the Go runtime. This structure contains:

- The stack for the goroutine (initially small, around 2KB)
- The program counter (PC) is indicating the current execution point
- References to the goroutine's current stack frame
- The goroutine's status (running, runnable, waiting, etc.)
- Channel wait queues when the goroutine is blocked on channel operations
- References to other goroutines it might be blocking

```
type g struct {
    stack       stack   // Stack bounds
    stackguard0 uintptr // Stack guard for Go code
    stackguard1 uintptr // Stack guard for C code

    _panic       *_panic // Panic recovery info
    _defer       *_defer // Deferred function calls

    m            *m      // Current M (OS thread)
    sched        gobuf   // Scheduling data

    // ... many more fields
}
```

### Goroutine Creation

When you use the `go` keyword to start a goroutine, the Go runtime:

1. Allocates a new `g` structure
2. Allocates a small stack (typically 2KB)
3. Records the function to call and its arguments
4. Puts the goroutine in a queue of runnable goroutines
5. If needed, wakes up or creates an OS thread to run goroutines

The actual creation is handled by the `newproc` function in the runtime, which is called when you use the `go` statement:

```
// Simplified version of what happens when you write "go f(args)"
func newproc(siz int32, fn *funcval) {
    argp := add(unsafe.Pointer(&fn), sys.PtrSize)
    gp := getg()
    pc := getcallerpc()

    // Create a new goroutine
    newg := newproc1(fn, argp, siz, gp, pc)

    // Make it runnable
    runqput(gp.m.p.ptr(), newg, true)

    // If there are idle P's and no spinning threads, wake one up
    if atomic.Load(&sched.npidle) != 0 && atomic.Load(&sched.nmspinning) == 0 {
        wakep()
    }
}
```

### Stack Management

Goroutines start with a small stack (2KB) that can grow and shrink as needed. This is achieved through a technique called **stack splitting**:

1. Each function checks if it has enough stack space at the beginning
2. If not, the runtime allocates a larger stack
3. Copies the contents of the old stack to the new one
4. Updates pointers and continues execution

This allows Go to create thousands of goroutines without consuming too much memory.

## Go Scheduler

### Components of the Scheduler

The Go scheduler is a user-space scheduler that multiplexes goroutines onto OS threads. It consists of three main components:

1. **G (Goroutine)**: Represents a goroutine
2. **M (Machine)**: Represents an OS thread
3. **P (Processor)**: Represents a resource required to execute Go code, including a local queue of runnable goroutines

```

└──────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └──────────────┘
```

### Scheduling Algorithm

The Go scheduler uses a work-stealing algorithm:

1. Each P has a local queue of runnable goroutines
2. When a P runs out of goroutines, it tries to steal from other Ps
3. If no goroutines are available locally, it checks the global queue
4. If still no goroutines, it will try to steal from other Ps' local queues
5. If all else fails, it will park the M (put it to sleep)

```
// Simplified version of the scheduler's main loop
func schedule() {
    gp := findrunnable() // Find a runnable goroutine

    if gp == nil {
        // No runnable goroutines, park the M
        stopm()
        return
    }

    execute(gp) // Run the goroutine
}

func findrunnable() *g {
    // Try local queue
    if gp := runqget(_p_); gp != nil {
        return gp
    }

    // Try global queue
    if gp := globrunqget(_p_, 0); gp != nil {
        return gp
    }

    // Try to steal from other P's
    if gp := stealwork(); gp != nil {
        return gp
    }

    // No work found
    return nil
}
```

### GOMAXPROCS

The `GOMAXPROCS` environment variable or function controls the maximum number of Ps (processors) that can be active simultaneously. This effectively limits the number of goroutines that can execute in parallel.

When you call `runtime.GOMAXPROCS(n)`:

1. The runtime adjusts the number of P structures
2. If increasing, it creates new P structures and adds them to the idle list
3. If decreasing, it removes P structures and moves their goroutines to the global queue

### Preemption

Prior to Go 1.14, goroutine preemption was cooperative, meaning goroutines had to reach specific points in the code to be preempted. Since Go 1.14, the runtime uses asynchronous preemption:

1. The runtime sets a preemption flag on goroutines that have been running too long
2. When a goroutine makes a function call, it checks this flag
3. Additionally, the runtime can now interrupt a goroutine by sending a signal to the OS thread

This prevents long-running goroutines from monopolizing CPU time.

## Channel Implementation

### Internal Structure

Channels in Go are represented by the `hchan` structure in the runtime:

```
type hchan struct {
    qcount   uint           // Number of elements in the queue
    dataqsiz uint           // Size of the circular queue
    buf      unsafe.Pointer // Points to an array of dataqsiz elements
    elemsize uint16         // Element size
    closed   uint32         // Channel closed flag
    elemtype *_type         // Element type

    sendx    uint           // Send index
    recvx    uint           // Receive index

    recvq    waitq          // List of recv waiters
    sendq    waitq          // List of send waiters

    lock mutex              // Protects all fields
}
```

Key components:
- A circular buffer for storing data (for buffered channels)
- Queues for goroutines waiting to send or receive
- A mutex to protect the structure from concurrent access
- Metadata about the element type and size

### Channel Operations

#### Channel Creation

When you call `make(chan T, size)`:

1. The runtime allocates memory for the `hchan` structure
2. If the channel is buffered, it allocates memory for the buffer
3. Initializes the structure fields

```
func makechan(t *chantype, size int) *hchan {
    elem := t.elem

    // Compute size needed for buffer
    mem := size * elem.size

    // Allocate memory for hchan
    c := new(hchan)
    c.buf = mallocgc(mem, elem, true)
    c.elemsize = uint16(elem.size)
    c.elemtype = elem
    c.dataqsiz = uint(size)

    return c
}
```

#### Sending on a Channel

When you send a value on a channel (`ch <- v`):

1. The runtime acquires the channel's lock
2. If there's a goroutine waiting to receive:
   - Dequeue a receiver from `recvq`
   - Copy the data directly to the receiver
   - Resume the receiving goroutine
3. Otherwise, if there's space in the buffer:
   - Copy the data to the buffer
   - Increment `sendx` and `qcount`
4. Otherwise:
   - Add the current goroutine to `sendq`
   - Block until a receiver arrives

#### Receiving from a Channel

When you receive from a channel (`v := <-ch`):

1. The runtime acquires the channel's lock
2. If there's a goroutine waiting to send:
   - Dequeue a sender from `sendq`
   - Copy the data directly from the sender
   - Resume the sending goroutine
3. Otherwise, if there's data in the buffer:
   - Copy the data from the buffer
   - Decrement `qcount` and increment `recvx`
4. Otherwise:
   - Add the current goroutine to `recvq`
   - Block until a sender arrives

#### Closing a Channel

When you close a channel (`close(ch)`):

1. The runtime acquires the channel's lock
2. Sets the `closed` flag
3. Releases all goroutines waiting on the channel:
   - Receivers get the zero value of the channel's type
   - Senders panic (if any are waiting)

### Select Statement

The `select` statement allows a goroutine to wait on multiple channel operations. Internally:

1. The runtime evaluates all channel expressions
2. If any case can proceed immediately, one is chosen at random
3. Otherwise, the goroutine is registered in the `recvq` or `sendq` of all channels
4. When one operation can proceed, the goroutine is removed from all other queues

This is implemented using a complex algorithm that ensures fairness and prevents deadlocks.

## Synchronization Primitives

### Mutex

The `sync.Mutex` type provides mutual exclusion. Internally, it uses a combination of atomic operations and OS primitives:

```
type Mutex struct {
    state int32  // Represents the state of the mutex
    sema  uint32 // Semaphore for parking goroutines
}
```

The `state` field encodes:
- Whether the mutex is locked
- Whether there are waiters
- Whether the mutex is starving (giving preference to waiters)

#### Locking a Mutex

When you call `mutex.Lock()`:

1. Try to acquire the mutex using atomic compare-and-swap (CAS)
2. If successful, return immediately
3. If not, enter a spin-wait loop (on multicore machines)
4. If spinning doesn't help, put the goroutine to sleep using the semaphore

```
func (m *Mutex) Lock() {
    // Fast path: grab unlocked mutex
    if atomic.CompareAndSwapInt32(&m.state, 0, mutexLocked) {
        return
    }

    // Slow path
    m.lockSlow()
}
```

#### Unlocking a Mutex

When you call `mutex.Unlock()`:

1. Atomically decrement the state
2. If there are waiters, wake one up using the semaphore

### RWMutex

The `sync.RWMutex` allows multiple readers or a single writer:

```
type RWMutex struct {
    w           Mutex  // Writer lock
    writerSem   uint32 // Writer semaphore
    readerSem   uint32 // Reader semaphore
    readerCount int32  // Number of readers
    readerWait  int32  // Number of readers waiting for write lock
}
```

It uses a combination of a regular mutex and atomic operations to track readers and writers.

### WaitGroup

The `sync.WaitGroup` is used to wait for a collection of goroutines to finish:

```
type WaitGroup struct {
    noCopy noCopy
    state1 [3]uint32 // Contains counter and semaphore
}
```

The `state1` field encodes:
- A counter of remaining tasks
- A counter of waiters
- A semaphore for parking goroutines

#### Add Operation

When you call `wg.Add(delta)`:

1. Atomically add `delta` to the counter
2. If the counter becomes zero and there are waiters, wake them all up

#### Wait Operation

When you call `wg.Wait()`:

1. If the counter is zero, return immediately
2. Otherwise, increment the waiter count
3. Block on the semaphore until the counter reaches zero

### Atomic Operations

Go provides atomic operations through the `sync/atomic` package. These operations are implemented using special CPU instructions that guarantee atomicity:

- `atomic.AddInt64`: Uses the CPU's atomic add instruction (e.g., LOCK XADD on x86)
- `atomic.CompareAndSwapInt64`: Uses the CPU's compare-and-swap instruction (e.g., LOCK CMPXCHG on x86)
- `atomic.LoadInt64`: Uses memory barriers to ensure visibility of loads
- `atomic.StoreInt64`: Uses memory barriers to ensure visibility of stores

These operations are the building blocks for higher-level synchronization primitives and lock-free data structures. They provide guarantees about memory ordering that are essential for correct concurrent programming.

## Memory Model

Go's memory model defines the conditions under which reads of a variable in one goroutine can be guaranteed to observe values produced by writes to the same variable in a different goroutine.

### Happens-Before Relationship

The key concept in Go's memory model is the "happens-before" relationship:

1. Within a single goroutine, the happens-before order is the order expressed by the program.
2. A send on a channel happens-before the corresponding receive from that channel completes.
3. A receive from an unbuffered channel happens-before the send on that channel completes.
4. The closing of a channel happens-before a receive that returns a zero value because the channel is closed.
5. A receive from a channel of capacity C happens-before the Cth subsequent send on that channel completes.
6. For any sync.Mutex or sync.RWMutex variable l and n < m, the nth call to l.Unlock() happens-before the mth call to l.Lock() returns.
7. For any call to sync.WaitGroup.Add(delta) with delta > 0, the happens-before relationship applies to the nth call to Wait if it corresponds to the nth decrement of the counter to zero.

### Memory Reordering

The Go memory model allows the compiler and CPU to reorder memory operations for performance, as long as the reordering is not observable within a single goroutine. This means that:

1. Reads and writes may be reordered by the compiler or CPU
2. The reordering must not be visible to the goroutine performing the operations
3. Synchronization operations (channels, mutexes, etc.) establish happens-before relationships that constrain reordering

### Data Races

A data race occurs when two goroutines access the same memory location concurrently, and at least one of the accesses is a write. Data races are undefined behavior in Go and can lead to unpredictable results.

Go provides a race detector (`-race` flag) that can identify data races at runtime by instrumenting memory accesses and tracking the happens-before relationships.

## Runtime Improvements

Go's concurrency features have evolved significantly over time, with several important improvements to the runtime:

### Scheduler Improvements

1. **Work-stealing scheduler (Go 1.1)**: Replaced the original scheduler with a more efficient work-stealing design.
2. **Preemptive scheduling (Go 1.14)**: Added asynchronous preemption to prevent long-running goroutines from monopolizing CPU time.
3. **NUMA-aware scheduling (Go 1.14+)**: Better handling of Non-Uniform Memory Access architectures.
4. **Improved scalability**: Reduced contention on the global run queue and other shared resources.

### Goroutine Improvements

1. **Stack management**: Evolved from segmented stacks to contiguous stacks (Go 1.3) for better performance.
2. **Stack size**: Reduced initial stack size from 8KB to 2KB to allow for more goroutines.
3. **Stack scanning**: Improved garbage collection of stacks with better algorithms for finding pointers.
4. **Goroutine parking**: More efficient mechanisms for parking and unparking goroutines.

### Channel Improvements

1. **Lock contention**: Reduced lock contention in channel operations.
2. **Buffer management**: More efficient memory usage for buffered channels.
3. **Select fairness**: Improved fairness in select statements with multiple ready cases.

### Synchronization Improvements

1. **Mutex implementation**: Enhanced mutex implementation to reduce contention and prevent starvation (Go 1.9).
2. **RWMutex performance**: Improved read-write mutex performance for read-heavy workloads.
3. **Atomic operations**: Better integration with the memory model and more efficient implementation.

### Memory Management

1. **Garbage collector**: Significantly improved GC latency with concurrent marking and sweeping.
2. **Memory allocator**: Better handling of small allocations common in goroutine stacks and channels.
3. **Memory locality**: Improved data locality for better cache utilization.

These improvements have made Go's concurrency model more efficient, scalable, and reliable over time, allowing developers to build highly concurrent applications with confidence.
